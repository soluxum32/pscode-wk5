// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

1. Start
2. Input first_number
3. Input second_number
4. Set sum = first_number + second_number
5. Display sum
6. End

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Input: num (an integer)

if num % 2 == 0 then
    Output: "num is even"
else
    Output: "num is odd"
end if

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

1. Initialize sum to 0
2. Initialize min and max to the first number entered
3. Initialize a counter variable count to 1
4. Repeat the following steps 4 more times:
   a. Read a number from the user and store it in a variable num
   b. Add num to sum
   c. If num is less than min, set min to num
   d. If num is greater than max, set max to num
   e. Increment count by 1
5. Calculate the average by dividing sum by 5 and store it in a variable avg
6. Print "The average of the five numbers is: " followed by avg
7. Print "The smallest number is: " followed by min
8. Print "The largest number is: " followed by max
